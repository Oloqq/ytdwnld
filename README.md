# YtDwnld
Download songs or whole playlists from yt with one command.

## Usage
ytdnwlnd song LINK<br>
ytdwnld playlist LINK

<b>Pass links in quotes.</b>

Playlists will be downloaded into a subfolder named after that playlist's name.<br>
Single tracks will be downloaded into "./ytdwnld_singles".

<b>You can easily update a playlist and re-run ytdnwld on it. The songs already present in the expected directory will not be downloaded again.</b>

I'll make destination folder configurable by CLI one day no scam.

The program will crash sometime and oops too bad I have too much math to care.
